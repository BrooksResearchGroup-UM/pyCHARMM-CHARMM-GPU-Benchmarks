# pyCHARMM/CHARMM GPU Benchmarks
## This repository contains benchmarks for the CHARMM/pyCHARMM program for computations run on current GPU platforms. These include the standard JAC/DHFR, ApoA1, DMPG and STMV benchmarks, ranging in system size from ~23K atoms to ~1M atoms. In addition, new benchmarks illustrate the application of MS$\lambda$D for both protein (T4 Lysoyme) and ligand (HSP90) relative free energy (RFE) calculations. The ApoA1, DMPG and STMV, as well as the two MS$\lambda$ benchmarks have been updated to utilize the recent CHARMM 36 parameter sets. The JAC/DHFR benchmark is adapted from the early benchmark developed by Brooks and Case for CHARMM and Amber.
